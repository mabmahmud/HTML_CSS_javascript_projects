                  ****HTML WEBForm Using Bootstrap**** 
				  
				  
Create a properly coded html web form using Bootstrap (remember our programming standards from web app). Just include the bootstrap css file. I don't want to see a whole website for this assignment. See this page for bootstrap form examples. Feel free to use the cdn for bootstrap instead of downloading it to your local computer. Your form could be for an online order of any sort, a store checkout screen, a bowling alley point-of-sale system, you know, something interesting.
Html file name = orderItem.html
•	Ensure that all of your html content is a div with an id of container. Give this div a 1px solid grey border with 10px of padding. 15px of top margin too, please. Add some user instructions and flair to make your page professional looking and/or visually appealing.
Js file name = processOrder.js

Each of the fields below should have a form label that informs the user what is expected as an input. Each field label should appear above its input element. Your form content should be left aligned. Include an example of each of the following:
•	3 text fields
•	1 textarea field
•	2 drop down (select) fields (with 4 values minimum each)
•	5 checkbox fields (one group)
•	4 radio buttons (two groups of two radio buttons each) 
•	1 button that, when clicked, will display your info in the output div (just use <button type="button">)
•	1 button that, when clicked, will reset the form and clear the output div contents
When the submit button is clicked, I would like you to use JavaScript to retrieve all data entered in the form and output it into a div with an id of outputDiv. Simply get the data from the form and display it in a separate div (when the user clicks the submit button)... HINT: Feel free to make more divs, spans, etc, inside the outputDiv. Ensure that I know which data belongs to which label. If the field or field group is empty or not filled out, display "None" in your output. You do not have to programmatically get the label values, you can hard-code these into your outputDiv.
For two of the fields above, use some math or logic to calculate and display something different based on the user's choice(s) in the form. For full marks this must reside inside of a separate function. Use your imagination.
Clicking a form button called reset, should reset the page, clear the filled in form values and the outputDiv. This could be done in many ways.
NOTE: If you are not clear on any of the instructions above, make sure you check with me. 
Matrix
•	/3 Proper code alignment, nesting, lowerCamelCasing (all files)
•	/2 Informative, spell-checked header and inline comments (all files)
•	/2 All js code is wrapped in functions - use descriptive names for functions and vars
•	/1 HTML, CSS, and JS are kept separate - can't use onclick event directly on html button - must use attachEvent or addEventListener in js
•	/2 HTML container div and CSS as requested 
•	/3 Bootstrap CSS is employed on all form elements as well as the page in general
•	/6 Text fields output to the screen in proper div
•	/4 Textarea field output to the screen in proper div
•	/4 Select (dropdown) values are displayed

•	/8 Which radio button was checked from each group.
•	/5 "None" appears for all fields not filled out
•	/6 Calculation/logic for two fields is commented, works well, and serves a purpose. Enclosed in a proper function.
•	/6 Clear/reset form functionality (output div cleared as well)
