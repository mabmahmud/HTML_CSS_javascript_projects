The client, Jillian, has been using this web interface for years for her small business. In her minigolf hut, she uses an old desktop computer to run this web application. She simply enters the party information, applies any discounts and the system will compute the taxes/discounts and then show the total. The system will also calculate how much change the customer should get back. Jillian would like to be able to free herself from her desk and use her application on a mobile device, probably a tablet. She would also like a more modern look and feel to the application. 
Your job is to update the look and feel, and, "while you are at it...", you might as well update and clean up the code.
Marking Matrix
Some things you will want to tackle:
•	/5 putting the js, css, and html into their own respective files
•	/2 ensure all code is indented and aligned to our CIS standards (variable names, camelCasing, ES6 (use let)) ensure there is no onclick or onchange remaining in the html - this stuff should be in the js code
•	/3 updating all comments (remember, you didn't write the original code so you can't take credit for it, however, you did make modifications and updates and your header comment edits should reflect this)
•	replacing (wherever possible) the old javascript with jQuery code (hopefully reducing the overall lines of js)
o	you do not have to use jQuery FORE completely everything, just use it when it makes sense to use it  - the idea is to reduce the amount of code you need - be mindful of how efficient your code is
o	/15 getting and setting of page content using jQuery
o	/5 any onload activities using jQuery
•	/5 adjusted the layout to make the application easier to read and use (Leveraging bootstrap, just linking the file at the top of your page is not enough. You need to leverage some of the built-in bootstrap classes and apply them in your application)
•	/5 add a neat NEW feature you think that Jillian would like - use jQuery for this. Perhaps an effect, a show/hide, an animation? How about a jQuery UI Widget like DatePicker, Checkboxradio.  Use your imagination.
