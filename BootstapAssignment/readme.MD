                  ****Bootstrap Assignment**** 



For this assignment you will demonstrate that you are able to utilize the bootstrap css library to set up a responsive web site that includes a number of components. 

Utilizing the bootstrap framework (v3.3.7), build a web site that consists of the following:

    /5 Properly link the bootstrap css and bootstrap.js files (locally), not using the CDN. These folders should be in the root directory of your project (css, js, and fonts).  
    /10 Bootstrap navigation menu (navbar) - This should be fixed to the top of the page (meaning it is visible all of the time), with working href links (on the right side). This menu should be responsive and placed on your main site page named index.html. It should contain links to the following pages. Notice the hierarchy of links as they are presented below. Home, Products, Services, Warranty, and Contact should be top level items, nested items should be contained in a drop-down menu as in the example from the tutorial site we did in class. These links should NOT open in a new window.
        Home - index.html
        Products - no link (use #)
            Hoovers - hoovers.html
            Dyson - #
            Fans -#
            Microwaves - #
        Services - 
            Cleaning - #
            Washing - #
            Storing - #
        Warranty - warranty.html
        Contact - #
    /5 Menu branding - add a clever appliance shop name to the branding area. You can choose to try adding a logo or not, up to you.
    /5 Directly below the navigation menu on index.html there should be a  jumbotron component with some simple text in it. The content of this jumbotron should NOT be a direct copy and paste from the in-class example. 
    /10 Below the jumbotron, there should be 1 row with a 4 column layout (grid-system). Remember your columns should add up to "12". Add an <h2> title and some lorem ipsum to each column to demonstrate.
    /15 As well as creating the main index.html file, I would like you to create the .html pages for Hoovers (e.g. hoovers.html) and Warranty. These pages should contain the same navigation menu (navbar) items as your main index.html page. All menu items should be included in all of your html pages. For these pages, do not include the jumbotron component, instead please add one row with that spans 12 all columns (grid-system) i.e. one row with one column). Inside the column add an <h2> with the either Hoovers or Warranty respectively. Please use Hoovers and Warranty as the page title for each page respectively.
    /15 Place a custom.css file to your site's /css folder and override 5 of the default bootstrap styles. Ensure this file has a proper header comment and some inline comments that clearly describe what each override is for. 
    /5 Demonstrated clean coding by using
        properly nested and/or closed elements
        proper use of new lines/white space
        indenting
        camelCasing
    /5 Proper header and inline comments of any pages you create. You do not need to place header comments in any of the bootstrap files.

    Total: /75 points
