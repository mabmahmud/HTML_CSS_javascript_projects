Create a small business website that consists of three linked pages.  The content can be based on a real or fictional business. One of the pages should be titled index.html (this would be the main page). The other page names should be meaningful and use lowerCamelCasing. You will design a service based site or perhaps it is a product you are selling?

There should be enough content on each page so that it looks and feels like it might be an actual business site. Please no dummy or filler text. Try your marketing hand at writing some good page text. Each page should have

    a proper page <title>
    at least one heading, <h1> or<h2> for example
    at least one image (prepared for the web)
    and at least 2 paragraphs of text.
    each page should also have a navigation menu consisting of href links contained within an unordered list 

I will be looking for the following things:

    /5 Demonstrated clean coding by using
        properly nested and/or closed elements
        proper use of new lines/white space
        indenting
        meaningful page titles
        lowerCamelCasing file names, class and id names, folder names, image names

    /15 Each of your pages should see ALL of your page content inside of a <div> with an id of container. The div should be centered horizontally on the page and have a solid border 2px wide that has a color. The div must also have a background color. Ensure you use a padding value of 30px, and a top margin of 8px.  The width of the div should be 80%. 
    In addition to the above requirement - Use of CSS (please use an external css file - no copy/paste, verbatim code from example files)
        /6 at least 2 separate instances of each of the following : color, background-color, font-family
        /4 at least 4 uses of padding, margin
        /4 at least 2 custom classes, defined and used (example .myClass) and at least 2 custom ID's, defined and used (example #myDiv)
        /4 at least 2 of each <div> and <span>
        /6 at least 1 table styled with basic css (3 properties min), minimum 4 cols and 2 rows
        /6 at least 2 unordered or ordered lists (nav menu doesn't count) styled with css (3 properties min)
        /6 at least 3 images <img> stored locally - not linked from web, sized and linked properly (file size between 2kb and 600kb)
        /6 a hyperlink <a href> menu between pages using a list - not a table (no direct copy/paste from example files) - should be located at the top or top left of the page
        /6 Page comments on each page, including the style sheet (author name, date, purpose - ensure purpose is a fully developed statement) - inline comments as needed
        /2 NO inline attribute styling - no instances of align=center, font color=... , <center>, <u>, <b>, <i>, width="....px" height="...px" - all styling should be in an EXTERNAL CSS FILE

    /5 Proper spelling and grammar in your web page text. Full sentences used. Colors and styles chosen work to support the purpose of the site. 

    Total: /75 points

    Try and get your html code as clean as you can - meaning I don't want to see any styling in your .html pages <font> <b> <i> <center> <align> - the styling should be done in your .css file
    Doctype declared
    Remember to quote your attribute values as required (example: <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>
    Minimum of 3 HTML pages, -> Don't forget to ZIP
    Submissions must come in via SAM - in other words - if your site is too large for SAM you must resize your images to make it work.
