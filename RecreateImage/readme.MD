                  ****Advanced CSS Assignment**** 


Your task is to recreate the image (found in starting package) below using clean HTML, CSS, and the three images provided.

Remember:

    HTML & CSS
        Should be aligned and indented
        HTML Tags Should NOT contain any styling
        Should contain proper header comments
        Should be organized and tidy
        CSS should be in an EXTERNAL sheet
        Remember to make your CSS as reusable as possible (when in doubt make it a class)
        HTML page title should be "Assignment 4"
        HTML page filename should be theCave.html
        CSS file should be named styles.css and should reside in a directory called css
        ALL HTML page content should be inside the container div with an id "container"
        I haven't specified any particular font family or sizes, my monitor is the same as your in-class lab monitor set to 1440x900px.
